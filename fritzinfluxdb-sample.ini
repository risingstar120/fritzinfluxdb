### Welcome to the fritzinfluxdb configuration file

# The values in this file override the default values used by the system if
# a config option is not specified. The commented out lines are the configuration
# field and the default value used. Uncommenting a line and changing the value
# will change the value used at runtime when the process is restarted.

# It is also possible to define multiple config files using the '-c' option.
# they are parsed in order of definition and later parsed config options
# overwrite config options defined in previous config files

# These config values can also be overwritten using environment variables.
# schema: <SECTION_NAME>_<CONFIG_OPTION>  (all in capital letters)
# example for InfluxDB token:
#   export INFLUXDB_TOKEN="abcedef"
